**AirBnB Clone - The Console**

**Description of the project**

The console is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the AirBnB website. This interface is responsible for handling various actions such as creating new objects, updating existing objects, retrieving information about objects, and deleting objects. The goal of the console is to make it easy for users to manage the objects on the AirBnB website, such as rooms, apartments, and listings, without having to navigate the website itself.

The console is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, which allows for the creation of classes and objects that represent the different elements of the AirBnB website. This makes it possible to store and retrieve information about objects in a structured way and to easily manipulate the data in response to user commands.

Overall, the console is an important component of the AirBnB project and plays a crucial role in the functionality and usability of the website.
